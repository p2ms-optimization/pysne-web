def generate_sobol_points(num_points, dimension, domain):
    """
    Generates sample points using a Sobol sequence (low-discrepancy sequence) scaled to a specified domain.

    The uniform distribution of initial population of points is much desired in order to obtain all candidate solutions in the clustering phase. Using 
    the Sobol sequence ensures the generated points in the search region have minimum deviation from uniformity. If the Sobol sequence generation fails 
    (e.g., due to dimensionality limits), this function safely falls back to a standard pseudo-random uniform distribution.

    Parameters
    ----------
    num_points : int
        The number of points to generate. For optimal spatial balance properties of the Sobol sequence, this value should ideally be a power of two (2^m).
    dimension : int
        The dimensionality of the sample space.
    domain : list of tuple
        The lower and upper bounds for each dimension. The expected format is a sequence of tuples, e.g., [(min_1, max_1), (min_2, max_2), ..., (min_d, max_d)].

    Returns
    -------
    numpy.ndarray
        An array of shape (num_points, dimension) containing the sample points scaled to the specified `domain`.

    Raises
    ------
    IndexError
        If the `domain` structure lacks the appropriate lower and upper bounds for each dimension.
